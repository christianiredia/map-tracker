# Map Tracker

In this application I will be creating a map that you can use to track your workouts. _Time, distance, and much more_.

I will be implementing things like geolocation to show the user current location. Logging in additional things like speed, elevation gain, etc.

I will be working mainly out of the **JavaScript** file.
The html and css code was provided by Jonas Schmedtmann.
